I am an incoming CS PhD student at Stanford. My research intersts are in systems security and applied cryptography.

Previously, I completed my M.S. in CS (2025) and two B.S. in CS with [Honors](/files/The_Avg_Act_Swap__ACM_CODASPY_submission___Copy_.pdf) and Mathematics (2024) at Stanford, where I was advised by Professors Dan Boneh, David Mazi√©res, and John Mitchell.
