I am interested broadly in systems security and applied cryptography research.

I recently received my Master's (2025) and two Bachelor's in Computer Science with [Honors](/files/The_Avg_Act_Swap__ACM_CODASPY_submission___Copy_.pdf) and Mathematics (2024) from Stanford University.

I will be starting my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in Fall 2025.

My research interests
------
I like to design, build, and evaluate systems that
<ol>
  <li> rely on advanced <u>cryptography</u> for precise security, </li>
  <li> can <u>evolve and scale</u> with changing system needs, and </li>
  <li> empower <u>end-users</u>.</li>
</ol>
You can view my previous and current research projects in the [Research](https://ihyunnam.github.io/research/) tab.
