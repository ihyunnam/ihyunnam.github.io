I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in security, systems, and cryptography and am most excited about **building secure systems with cryptography** that has real-life applications. I am very fortunate to be advised by professors [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/), [David Mazieres](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/), and [John Mitchell](https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/), and to have worked previously with professor [Zakir Durumeric](https://zakird.com/).

I received my B.S. with [Honors](/files/honors.pdf) in Computer Science on the Systems track and B.S. in Mathematics from Stanford University in June 2024.
