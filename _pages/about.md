I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University. I am intersted in building secure systems with cryptography that has real-life applications.

I am very fortunate to be advised by professors [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/), [David Mazieres](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/), and [John Mitchell](https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/), and to have worked previously with professor [Zakir Durumeric](https://zakird.com/). I received my B.S. with [Honors](/files/honors.pdf) in Computer Science on the Systems track and B.S. in Mathematics from Stanford University in June 2024.

<span style="color: red;">I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science for the fall 2025 entry term.</span>

Here is my [CV](/files/cv.pdf).
