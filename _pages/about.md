Hello! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University. My research interests are in secure systems and applied cryptography. **I am applying for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science for the fall 2025 entry term.**

I am very fortunate to be advised by professors [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/), [David Mazieres](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/), and [Emma Dauterman](https://cs.stanford.edu/~edauterman/), and previously by Professor [John Mitchell](https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/). I received my B.S. with [Honors](/files/The_Avg_Act_Swap__ACM_CODASPY_submission___Copy_.pdf) in Computer Science as well as B.S. in Mathematics from Stanford University in June 2024.

My Research Interests
------
I'm most interested in designing, building, and evaluating systems that...
<ol>
  <li> rely on advanced cryptography for precise security, </li>
  <li> can evolve and scale with changing system needs, and </li>
  <li> empower honest users.</li>
</ol>
You can view my previous and current research projects in the [Research](https://ihyunnam.github.io/research/) tab.

Contact
------
You can reach me most conveniently at ihyun [at] stanford [dot] edu.
