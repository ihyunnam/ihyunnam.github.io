I will be starting my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in Fall 2025. My research interests are in secure systems and applied cryptography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Professors [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/), [David Mazieres](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/), and [Emma Dauterman](https://cs.stanford.edu/~edauterman/), and previously by Professor [John Mitchell](https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/). I received my Master's in Computer Science (2025) and two Bachelor's in Computer Science with [Honors](/files/The_Avg_Act_Swap__ACM_CODASPY_submission___Copy_.pdf) and Mathematics (2024) from Stanford University.

My research interests
------
I am broadly interested in secure systems and applied cryptography. I like to design, build, and evaluate systems that
<ol>
  <li> rely on advanced <u>cryptography</u> for precise security, </li>
  <li> can <u>evolve and scale</u> with changing system needs, and </li>
  <li> empower <u>end-users</u>.</li>
</ol>
You can view my previous and current research projects in the [Research](https://ihyunnam.github.io/research/) tab.

Contact
------
You can reach me most conveniently at ihyun [at] stanford [dot] edu.
