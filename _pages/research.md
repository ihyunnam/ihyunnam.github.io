**Authentication Logging to a Public Blockchain**
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Professors David Mazières and Emma Dauterman
<br>Winter 2023–Present</span>
<br>Authentication logging is a way to detect credential compromises by recording a user’s complete authentication history. However, many existing single sign-on schemes like “Sign in with Google” achieve universal logging by giving a third party access to a user’s authentication history across all their accounts, compromising privacy. We are developing a new privacy-preserving authentication logging protocol with improved security guarantees from the state-of-the-art solution [larch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19241), that (1) does not require a trusted log server during enrollment and audit times and (2) guarantees privacy against a colluding log server and relying party. _Recipient of the IORH Blockchain Grant._

**A Sparse Polynomial Commitment Scheme from Lattices** [(Preprint)](/files/spartic.pdf)
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Professor Dan Boneh
<br>Winter 2023—Present</span>
<br>We built Spartic, the first sprase polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) from lattices with optimal prover costs linear in the polynomial sparsity. PCS is a primitive for comitting to a polynomial and later proving its evaluations. A ‘sparse’ PCS efficiently commits to large structures, which would otherwise be too expensive, by leveraging data sparsity. We adapted an existing field-based sparse PCS [Spark](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/550.pdf) to work on rings, including its time-optimal memory checking algorithm.

**Faster Fully Homomorphic Operations for Deep Circuits** [(Paper)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626232.3653277) [(Code)](https://github.com/ihyunnam/Avg-Act-Swap)
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Professor John Mitchell
<br>Summer 2023–Spring 2024</span>
<br>Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a privacy-preserving tool for computations on encrypted data. Many applications that use FHE in convolutional neural networks (CNN) use CNNs that are designed for unencrypted data as black boxes, simply feeding them FHE-encrypted data. This naive approach raises two problems: (1) CNNs require many multiplications, which, while trivial in standard settings, become the primary bottleneck in homomorphic settings due to modular arithmetics; and (2) repeated computations can overflow FHE-encrypted data, hurting data integrity. I developed the Avg-Act Swap, a method to transform any existing CNN to achieve faster encrypted inference when working on FHE-encrypted data, and the first known plaintext overflow detection scheme in fixed-point FHE. <ins>Paper published in the Proceedings of the 14th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY '24).</ins>

**Identifying TLS Clients with Unsupervised Learning on Domain Names** [(Paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02040) [(Code)](https://github.com/ihyunnam/clid)
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Professor Zakir Durumeric
<br>Winter 2023–Summer 2023</span>
<img width="200" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-04 at 15 46 35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cee39bbb-a101-45da-9a17-6b4035fc2941" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;"><br>Client identification is the practice of inferring clients' identities based on their network behavior. I showed that three state-of-the-art tools collectively identify only 6% of clients in a captured traffic, due to their reliance on hardcoded databases that grow outdated as the network landscape changes. Instead, I designed and evaluated a self-sustaining solution—Clid, a TLS client identification tool that uses unsupervised learning map clients to domain names indicative of their identities. Clid maps at least 60% of clients in test sets to informative domain names. _Paper posted on arXiv._

**Shuffle Squares and Reverse Shuffle Squares** [(Paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12455)
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Dr. Pawel Grzegrzolka
<br>Summer 2021–Fall 2021</span>
<br>We proved the Hanshall-Rampersad-Shallit conjecture (2012) on enumerating shuffle squares (words containing disjoint identical strings) and disproved a companion conjecture on reverse shuffle squares. We contributed to efficient error-correcting codes for deletion channels. <ins>Paper published in the European Journal of Combinatorics (Vol 116)</ins>.
