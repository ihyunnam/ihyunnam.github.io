**Authentication Logging to a Public Blockchain**
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Professors David Maziéres and Emma Dauterman
<br>Winter 2023–Present</span>
<br>Authentication logging is a way to detect credential compromises by recording a user’s complete authentication history. However, many existing single sign-on schemes like “Sign in with Google” enforce security against attackers by compromising user privacy and giving a third party access to a user’s authentication history across all their accounts. We are developing a new privacy-preserving authentication logging protocol with improved security guarantees from the state-of-the-art system called Larch, that (1) does not require a trusted third party to run a log server and (2) guarantee user security even when their log server and a relying party are colluding. _Recipient of the IORH Blockchain Grant._

**A Sparse Polynomial Commitment Scheme from Lattices [(Paper)]()**
<span style="color: grey;"><br>Advisor: Professor Dan Boneh
<br>Winter 2023—Present</span>
<br>Polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) are a primitive that allows one to commit to a polynomial and later prove its evaluations. A ‘sparse’ PCS enables efficient commitments to large structures, which would otherwise be too expensive, by leveraging the sparsity of data. Lattices offer quantum resistance that traditional assumptions lack, but lattice-based PCS is underexplored due to the high computational overhead expected when working with lattice structures. We are building a sparse PCS from lattices with sublinear verifier time, using an existing field-based sparse PCS called Spark and a proof system called LaBRADOR as our starting point. We have in mind applications to building post-quantum Lasso lookup arguments.

**Faster Fully Homomorphic Operations for Deep Circuits [(Paper)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626232.3653277) [(Code)](https://github.com/ihyunnam/Avg-Act-Swap)**

Many applications that use FHE in convolutional neural networks (CNN) use CNNs that are designed for unencrypted data as black boxes, simply feeding them FHE-encrypted data. This naive approach raises two problems: (1) CNNs require many multiplications, which, while trivial in standard settings, become the primary bottleneck in homomorphic settings due to modular arithmetics; and (2) repeated computations can overflow FHE-encrypted data, which is fatal to data integrity as there is no method to detect plaintext overflows. I developed the Avg-Act Swap, a method to transform any existing CNN to achieve faster encrypted inference when working on FHE-encrypted data, and the first known plaintext overflow detection scheme in floating-point FHE.I implemented two CNNs that, when transformed with the Swap, achieved a 39% faster encrypted inference speed with 98% accuracy; and modified the Lenet-5 neural network with the Swap to gain a 27% speedup with 90% accuracy. _Paper published in the Proceedings of the 14th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY)._

**Identifying TLS Clients Using Unsupervised Learning on Domain Names [(Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02040) [(Code)](https://github.com/ihyunnam/clid)**

I traced the problem to prior tools’ reliance on hardcoded databases that quickly grow outdated as the network landscape changes. With the aim of designing a self-sustaining solution, I built Clid: a TLS client identification tool that uses unsupervised learning and Bayesian optimization to identify domain names that are most indicative of the clients’ identities, among their previous connections. Clid maps at least 60% of clients in all test TLS connections to informative domain names. _Preprint posted on arXiv._

We contributed to efficient error-correcting codes for deletion channels. _Paper published in the European Journal of Combinatorics (Vol 116).
